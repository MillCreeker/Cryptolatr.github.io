				I had a great interest in TCGs (trading card games) since my early childhood. Back then it was "Yu-Gi-Oh!" which I loved playing dearly. Over the years I even played in a few local tournaments. There was a problem though: Money. I didn't have the hundreds of Euro I needed for a competitive viable deck. And even if I had one, it wouldn’t keep up in the long run. All good decks either get so many bans that the deck was virtually unplayable or it would be outperformed within three months due to better cards being released on a monthly basis.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I literally don’t have the time to mention all the flaws this game has (I didn’t even mention the ones concerning the gameplay). So I was searching for another, better TCG but I couldn’t really find one. Hearthstone has its own problems concerning money and magic was WAAAY too huge of a game for me to tap into.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				So I waited patiently for a new card game and oh lord, my prayers have been heard. Riot Games launched a campaign in 2019 in which it would earn its title Riot “Games”. Up until then it only had a single game: League of Legends (I’m sure everyone and their mother has heard about it). Among those games was a card game and a damn great one as well!
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				You can easily get the best cards without spending a penny within a week. The experience-system so far more generous than any other game on the market (don’t quote me on this please). The best cards - the champions - don’t even cost €2 whilst an expensive Yu-Gi-Oh!-card could cost you up to €20 (and next month they release a reprint ehich makes it worthless).

				But by far my favorite aspect is the gameplay itself and if you wanna read more about it you can check <a href="./getting-started.html">this</a> out.
