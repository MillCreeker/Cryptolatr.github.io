			<h1>Getting Started</h1>

			<p>
				Legends of Runeterra plays within the League of Legends universe. Its champions are well-known by fans and their abilities match their blueprint pretty well considering the genre-switch. Play wise it borrows lots of aspects from other games. Riot themselves said that they keep what works and dismiss things that don’t. And it’s because of this attitude that they made such a fantastic game. Hearthstones mana-system was good but LoR’s is slightly improved (through the means of spell-mana).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The most important game-mechanic has to be how turns work though. In 99% of turn based games players have strict turns. When it’s your opponents turn you can do nothing but wait until they’re finished (except some effect says otherwise). In LoR turns works quite different: When your opponent finishes his round, you have the attack token which means that you can attack this round. But after each card played the other player gets to play a card as if it was his turn. The ONLY difference is that you don’t have the attack token.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Another key aspect is the friendliness towards new players. Most effects have highlighted keywords which explain what they stand for in more detail when you hover over them. Besides, every unit has a large 16:9 picture and some flavor-text you can view at any point...
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I could sit here for days and not finish writing about all the different aspects of LoR but I think they’re best seen in practice (it’s free after all). But to give you an anchor point to start from I’ve made a list below which describes every region in a VERY generalized fashion. (Every card is from a specific region and you can only have a maximum of two different regions in one deck.)

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Region</th>
					<th>Playstyle</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Demacia</td>
					<td>Raw force. It's mostly about big numbers and overwhelming your opponent.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Freljord</td>
					<td>Buffs and debuffs. It trys to gain the upper hand by making itself stronger while weakening enemy units.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Ionia</td>
					<td>Effects. Ionia utilises lots of spells and unit-effects to limit the opponents options.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Noxus</td>
					<td>Pure aggression. With lots of burn damage and low cost units with high attack values this region can close out games fast.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Piltover & Zaun</td>
					<td>Spells. These cards thrive on spells and complicated interactions.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Shadow Isles</td>
					<td>Death's not the end. With lots of units which have effects when dying this region embraces death.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Bilgewater</td>
					<td>Mixed. As the newest set of cards this region compliments others very well with new keywords and effects.</td>
				</tr>
